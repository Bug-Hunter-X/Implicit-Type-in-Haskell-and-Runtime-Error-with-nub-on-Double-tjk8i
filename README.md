This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Haskell related to implicit typing and the use of the `nub` function from `Data.List`. The initial code compiles fine but throws a runtime error when the type of the list is explicitly specified as `Double`. This highlights the importance of specifying types explicitly in Haskell to avoid unexpected behavior and runtime errors. The solution demonstrates a way to handle this issue by using a custom function for removing duplicates that works for `Double` or using a type that is Ord.
